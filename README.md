# CSiBORG Tools

Tools for analysing constrained cosmological simulations.


## TODO
- [x] Remove Gaussian priors and switch to uniform. Can the beta preference be a volume effect?
- [x] Relax priors on the calibration parameters as well.
- [x] Verify the effects of resolution (compare how Carrick worsens).


## To present in the next meeting
- Resolution effects on the goodness-of-fit and the LG velocity.
- CF4 peculiar velocity samples.


## To discuss in the next meeting
- Get Helene Courtois' advice on the CF4 TFR samples.
