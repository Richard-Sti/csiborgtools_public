## :scroll: Short-term TODO
- [ ] Calculate mass functions
- [ ] Add functions for converting the output file to box units.
- [ ] Calculate catalogues for all realisations.
- [x] Verify the bulk flow of particles and the clump
- [x] Check why for some halos $M_{500c} > M_{200c}$



## :hourglass: Long-term TODO
- [ ] Improve file naming system
- [ ] Calculate the cross-correlation in CSiBORG. Should see the scale of the constraints?


## :bulb: Open questions
- Propagate uncertainty of $\log R_{\rm s}$ to concentration
