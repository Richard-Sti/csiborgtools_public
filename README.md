# CSiBORG Tools

Tools for analysing the suite of Constrained Simulations in BORG (CSiBORG) simulations. The interface is designed to work with the following suites of simulations: *CSiBORG1* (dark matter-only RAMSES), *CSiBORG2* (dark matter-only Gadget4), *Quijote* (dark-matter only Gadget2), however with little effort it can support other simulations as well.

## Ongoing projects

### Consistent halo reconstruction
- [ ] Make a sketch of the overlap definition and add it to the paper.
- [ ] Improve the storage system for overlaps and calculate it for all simulations.

### Enviromental dependence of galaxy properties
- [ ] Prepare the CSiBORG one particle files for SPH.
- [ ] Transfer, calculate the SPH density field for CSiBORG1 and transfer back.
- [x] Check that the velocity-field flipping of x and z coordinates is correct.
- [x] Evaluate and share the density field for SDSS and SDSSxALFALFA for both CSiBORG2 and random fields.
- [ ] Check and verify the density field of galaxy colours (cannot do this now! Glamdring is super slow.)

#### Calculated data
##### SPH-density & velocity field
- *CSiBORG2_main*, *CSiBORG2_random*, *CSiBORG2_varysmall*
- Evaluated for SDSS and SDSSxALFALFA in: *CSiBORG2_main*, *CSiBORG2_random*

#### Radial velocity field


### Mass-assembly of massive clusters
- [ ] Make a list of nearby most-massive clusters.
- [ ] Write code to identify a counterpart of such clusters.
- [ ] Write code to make a plot of mass-assembly of all clusters within a certain mass range from the random simulations.
- [ ] Write code to compare mass-assembly of a specific cluster with respect to random ones.


### Effect of small-scale noise
- [ ] Study how the small-scale noise variation affects the overlap measure, halo concentration and spin.

### Gravitational-wave and large-scale structure
- [ ] Make the velocity field data available.

### CSiBORG meets X-ray
- [ ] Make available one example snapshot from the simulation. Mention the issue with x- and z-coordinates.

### CSiBORG advertising
- [ ] Decide on the webpage design and what to store there.
- [ ] Write a short letter describing the simulations.
