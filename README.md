# CSiBORG Analysis


##  Project Overlap
- [x] Clean up the kNN paths in the summary.
- [x] Clean up the 2PCF paths in the summary.
- [x] Update the clustering scripts to work with clumps instead.
- [x] Sort out the splitting of individual clumps.
- [x] Update the fitting scripts to work for clumps and parent halos.

- [ ] When calculating the overlap now check whether the halos have any particles, but that should already be the case otherwise its initial CM will not be defined.
- [ ] Calculated fitted quantities for clumps and parent halos and add them to the catalogues.
- [ ] Update overlap scripts to work with summed parent halos.

- [ ] Calculate the overlap between all 101 IC realisations on DiRAC.


## Project Clustering

### Longterm
- [ ] Add uncertainty to the kNN-CDF autocorrelation?
- [ ] Add reading halo catalogues at higher redshifts.


### April 9 2023 Sunday
- [x] Add normalised marks calculation.
- [x] Add normalised marks to the submission scripts.
- [x] Verify analytical formula for the kNN of a uniform field.
- [x] For the cross-correlation try making the second field randoms.
- [x] Clean up the reader code.
- [x] Correct the crossing script.
- [x] Get started with the 2PCF calculation.

## Project Environmental Dependence
- [ ] Add gradient and Hessian of the overdensity field.
