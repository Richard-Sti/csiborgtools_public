# CSiBORG tools

## :scroll: Short-term TODO
- [x] Calculate $M_{\rm vir}, R_{\rm vir}, c$ from $R_s, \rho_0, \ldots$
- [x] In `NFWPosterior` correct for the radius in which particles are fitted.
- [x] Calculate $M_{\rm 500c}$ by sphere shrinking
- [x] Change to log10 of the scale factor
- [ ] Calculate uncertainty on $R_{\rm s}$, switch to `JAX` and get gradients.


## :hourglass: Long-term TODO
- [ ] Improve file naming system
- [ ] Calculate the cross-correlation in CSiBORG. Should see the scale of the constraints?
